High level assessment: undocumented youth are remarkably resilient and have a high hope for their future and self-efficacy. They are often impacted by multiple systems with a high overlap with being unhoused or systems impacted (probation, foster care, etc.). Opportunities for community involvement helps increase their hope for the future more and this is most important for undocumented and systems impacted youth who have lowest levels of opportunities for community involvement though they still have great hope for their future.
